This is a simple CNN built in Keras to predict wether an image contains a wildfire or not. Is is a CPU only implementation so runs on non CUDA compatible systems. It uses data from the Canadian government website (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9d8f219c-4df0-4481-926f-8a2a532ca003) in the form of a datset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelghaniaaba/wildfire-prediction-dataset). It automatically detects corrupted JPEG files in the dataset and removes them.
